# Module-5-HW
Hello!
Attached is the Module 5 Homework along with the data sources used to complete the assignment.

Analysis:
The consistancy of the timepoints for each treatment is relativley consistant which helps reduce bias among the study

For the drug regimen Capomulin the average tumor volume was positively correlated with mouse weight by the coefficiant of 0.84. This represents that the volume of the tumor was proportional to the weight of the mouse and can furthermore be a fair indication that tumor reduction will show a percemt of tumor volume or mouse weight.
